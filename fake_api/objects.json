    {"quotation": "The primitive value 'I am a string' is not an object, it’s a primitive literal and immutable value. To perform operations on it, such as checking its length, accessing its individual character contents, etc., a String object is required."},
    {"quotation": "Luckily, the language automatically coerces a string primitive to a String object when necessary, which means you almost never need to explicitly create the Object form."},
    {"quotation": "null is sometimes referred to as an object type, but this misconception stems from a bug in the language that causes typeof null to return the string 'object' in‐ correctly (and confusingly). In fact, null is its own primitive type."},
    {"quotation": "The top end of every normal [[Prototype]] chain is the built-in Object.prototype. This object includes a variety of common utilities used all over JS, because all normal (built-in, not host-specific exten‐ sion) objects in JavaScript “descend from” (aka have at the top of their [[Prototype]] chain) the Object.prototype object."}

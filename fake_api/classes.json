    {"quotation": "The mixin pattern (both explicit and implicit) is often used to sort of emulate class copy behavior, but this usually leads to ugly and brittle syntax like explicit pseudopolymorphism (OtherObj.method Name.call(this, ...)), which often results in code that is harder to understand and maintain."},

    {"quotation": "JS has had some class-like syntactic elements (like new and instanceof) for quite a while, and more recently in ES6, some additions, like the class keyword.<br/><br/>But does that mean JavaScript actually has classes? Plain and simple: <strong>NO</strong>."}
